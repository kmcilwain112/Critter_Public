# Critter_Public
 OCC CIS 2454 Final Project 

 
-For our final project in my Web System Development course, we were tasked with creating a clone of twitter.

-I chose to create Critter. A halloween themed twitter clone. 

-We created a MySQL database populated with users, tweets, and followers. 

-We used Java, JSP, SQL and CSS to create models, publish views, and create controllers.

-In the source directory you'll find the java/Critter directory which contains files for database connection, controllers, and models.
